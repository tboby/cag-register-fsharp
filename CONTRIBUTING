This app uses the SAFE stack.

It started as a client/server combo, but then I wanted to make it statically hosted so now it's a weird hybrid.

## Install pre-requisites

You'll need to install the following pre-requisites in order to build SAFE applications

* [.NET SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download) 8.0 or higher
* [Node 18](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or higher
* [NPM 9](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm) or higher

## Starting the application

To concurrently run the server and the client components in watch mode use the following command:

```bash
dotnet run
```

Then open `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

The build project in root directory contains a couple of different build targets. You can specify them after `--` (target name is case-insensitive).

To run concurrently server and client tests in watch mode (you can run this command in parallel to the previous one in new terminal):

```bash
dotnet run -- RunTests
```

Client tests are available under `http://localhost:8081` in your browser and server tests are running in watch mode in console.
