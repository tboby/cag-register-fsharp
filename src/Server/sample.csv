The original application specified that support would be required for the funding period of 5 years, as the funding period had been extended the application requested an extension to the initial support provided. A recommendation for class 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 support was requested to cover access to the following datasets: • ONS Births and Still births • ONS Cancer Incidence • Welsh Cancer Intelligence and Surveillance Unit. • ONS Mortality • National Congenital Anomaly Register (NCAR from ONS) • Local Congenital Anomaly registries affiliated with BINOCAR [CARIS (Wales), Glasgow Register of Congenital Anomalies, Merseyside and Cheshire Congenital Anomaly Survey, North Thames (West) Congenital Malformation Register, Northern Congenital Abnormality Survey (NORCAS), Oxfordshire Congenital Anomaly Register (OXCAR), Scottish Congenital Anomaly Register (SCAR), East Midlands & South Yorkshire Congenital Anomaly Register (formerly Trent), West Midlands Congenital Anomaly Register, Wessex Antenatally Detected Anomalies Register (WANDA), National Downs Syndrome Cytogenetic Register (NDSCR) • Terminations grounds “E” (that there is a substantial risk that if the child were born it would suffer from such physical • or mental abnormalities as to be seriously handicapped) • NN4B – currently expecting data for 20062011 • (data arrival expected November 2014). • HES Inpatients • HES A+E – current holdings • HES ONS mortality link – current holdings • NCCHD (National Community Child Health Database) Amendment 10/07/2015: CAG original approval had covered the SAHSU application but not unlimited data linkages. The applicant had been asked to come back when undertaking specific projects which required additional linkages. It was noted that the applicant confirmed that they will be using the approved methodology agreed at the CAG meeting. An amendment was requested in order to link between the ONS births registrations (enhanced with NN4B variables) and ONS mortality records to be able to analyse infant mortality as an outcome for two studies (12/LO/0566 and 12/LO/0567) covered by HRA - 14/CAG/1039 – Section 251 support; (supersedes NIGB - ECC 2-06(a)/2009).
